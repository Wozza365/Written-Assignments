### Examiner Feedback

```
Introduction (20%) 
A good introduction that defines the genre of interest and provides a good overview of the challenges 
using appropriate citations and game examples to support the statements. 
The rationale for the topic is also strong and the writing style is good. 
My only real criticism here is that you do not talk about levergaing cloud services as part of the introduction; 
this is a key part of the essay and so it deserves to be mentioned in the introduction. 14/20

Explanation (25%)  
You do not provide an 'Explanation' section per se, so I have taken your 'Leveraging Cloud Services' section in lieu of this
for the purposes of the marking criteria.You explain the problems well and also provide some solid, 
and well supported arguments for the use of cloud services. 
You use case study games to illustrate your points and there is evidence of some excellent research here. 
The section is well written and very informative. 20/25

State of the Art (35%)  
You do not provide an 'State of the Art' section per se, 
so I have taken the next two sections in lieu of this for the purposes of the marking criteria. 
There are some interesting facts here and some good discussion around them, 
but the subject of this section has drifted too far away from the subject of the essay, 
i.e. use of cloud services for the AI. This is not mentioned at all in this section. 
However, you have carried out some good research into the genre and have made good use of 
illustrations and citations to support the statements. 
Your writing style is also good. 23/35

Recommendations and Conclusion (20%) 
A very good section that sums the paper up well. 
You also provide some insightful thoughts regarding future directions for the genre. 16/20

## Foundations of Computer Science - **70%**

### Overview

### Examiner Feedback

```
Overall this paper follows a reasonable layout standard and has no major errors in formatting, 
referencing, spelling and grammar, or missing sections (intro / conclusion).

In terms of the overall content:
- the work displays a reasonable understanding of the overall concepts underlying RWD and links the work to XAML
where upon it goes slightly off topic but in a reasonable fashion.

- the coverage of GD vs PE again shows a good grasp of the basic concepts behind the technologies (Extend and Enhance vs Fallback and Alternative). 
The coverage though does not go into great depth in terms of the functional differences between these technologies 
and how they lead to the RWD design paradigm. Further referencing and image support would be beneficial to this work.

In terms of screen shots and code snippets:

- Choice of screen shots and explanations of the content were reasonable and conveyed some depth of information
that should be present to accurately show the process of RWD reflow layouts / media break points. 

- Images were insufficient explained and didn't show the process except in terms of real websites 
so a reader cannot make a clear distinction as to how the reflowing process is being performed.

- Captions and figure references could be more extensive.
